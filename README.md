# nfl_quality

The goal of this project is to determine how the quality of play in the NFL has changed over time.

Tom Brady in 2024 noted the decreased quality of play of quarterbacks especially, pointing to several reasons why this might be the case. Others have bemoaned the general quality of play across the NFL, a sentiment that I share about the past few seasons. 

But are the games actually worse? Are players performing worse than in the past?

In this project I will examine game scores and player performances to create benchmarks to measure against. I have data available from 1999, so I can find averages and benchmark from there. 

One possible end state is to haev a program that will compare the data from the most recent week of NFL play against an average to determine whether the week was a "good" week.
